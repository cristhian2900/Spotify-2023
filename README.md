Project Description:
The project is focused on analyzing the music streaming landscape to identify trends in artist popularity and platform dominance. The data provided highlights the most streamed artists, the most added artists to Spotify playlists, and the leading music streaming platforms (Spotify, Deezer, and Apple Music).

The primary objective of the project is to uncover actionable insights from this data that can inform marketing strategies for the music industry. By examining which artists are most popular and which platforms are most widely used, the project aims to guide promotional efforts, playlist curation, and platform-specific strategies to maximize audience engagement and stream growth.

Key Focus Areas:
Top Streamed Artists: Identifying artists with the highest total streams, including The Weeknd, Taylor Swift, and Ed Sheeran, to determine which artists have the most substantial audience reach.

Playlist Curation and Engagement: Understanding which artists are most frequently added to Spotify playlists, as this is a key metric for determining listener engagement and potential for organic promotion through user-generated content.

Platform Dominance: Analyzing which platforms hold the largest share of streams to help guide where marketing resources should be concentrated. Spotify, with 96.86% of user activity, is the clear leader.

Purpose:
The insights gathered from this project can be leveraged by music industry stakeholders such as artists, managers, and record labels to:

Enhance promotional strategies by targeting high-performing artists for special releases and collaborations.
Optimize platform-specific content by focusing efforts on Spotify, the most widely used platform.
Drive engagement through playlist strategies by promoting artists who are frequently added to playlists and encouraging user-generated playlists for better audience reach.
